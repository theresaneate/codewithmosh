Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
'Till the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit, light
Enter, night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Somethings wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit, light
Enter, night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
I prayâ€¦
