# Variables


# Make a program that displays several numbers.
var1 = str(1)
var2 = str(2)
var3 = str(3)

print("Var 1 is: " + var1)
print("Var 2 is: " + var2)
print("Var 3 is: " + var3)

# Make a program that solves and shows the summation of 64 + 32.
sum = 64 + 32
print("Summation 1 is: " + str(sum))

# Do the same as in 2, but make it sum x + y.
x = 64
y = 32
sum = x + y
print("Summation 2 is: " + str(sum))
